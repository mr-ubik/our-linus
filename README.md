An open source prayer to our Lord and Saviour Linus Torvalds.

`"My name is Linus Torvald and I am your God"` - Linus Torvalds

`
Our Linus, Who art in Linux
Open be thy source
Thy release come
Thy kernel be run
On mobile as it is on servers
Give us this day our daily commit
And forgive us our pull requests
As we forgive those who fork our code
And lead us not into mac-os
But deliver us from Microsoft. 
Sudo.
